**Question and Answering**

This code implements a **Question-Answering (QA) System** that combines **retrieval-based** and **generative** approaches. 
This system combining information retrieval (FAISS) and question-answering (BERT) to provide accurate answers to user queries. Itâ€™s particularly suitable for structured knowledge bases where the information can be retrieved based on semantic similarity.

### **1. Knowledge Base Preparation (Embedding and Indexing)**
- The knowledge base is loaded from a file, **`knowledge.txt`**, where each line in the file represents a distinct piece of information (e.g., a paragraph or a fact).
- Using the **Sentence Transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)**, each piece of knowledge (text) is converted into vector embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
- The **FAISS index** is used to store and retrieve these embeddings efficiently. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library optimized for fast similarity search and clustering. The **IndexFlatL2** is used here for **L2 (Euclidean) distance-based similarity search**, which is commonly used to find the most similar items in high-dimensional spaces (i.e., embeddings).

### **2. Retrieve Context**
- When the user asks a question, the **`retrieve_context`** function is called:
  - The input question is also converted into an embedding using the same **Sentence Transformer** model.
  - The FAISS index is queried to find the top-k most relevant pieces of knowledge (context) based on their similarity to the question embedding. The context is returned as a list of knowledge base lines that are deemed most relevant.

### **3. Answer Extraction using BERT**
- The **`answer_question`** function uses **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), specifically the **fine-tuned BERT model** on the **SQuAD** (Stanford Question Answering Dataset), to extract the answer from the context.
  - The BERT model is accessed via the Hugging Face **`pipeline`** for question-answering.
  - Given the **question** and the **retrieved context**, BERT finds the span of text in the context that most likely answers the question.

### **4. Main QA System Workflow**
- The main function (**`qa_system`**) combines the retrieval and answer extraction:
  - It first retrieves the most relevant context from the knowledge base using the **`retrieve_context`** function.
  - If a relevant context is found, it is passed to the **`answer_question`** function to extract the answer.
  - The answer is then returned to the user.

### **5. User Interaction**
- The system runs in a loop, allowing the user to continuously ask questions.
- The user can type **"exit"** or **"quit"** to stop the program.
- For each question, the system retrieves the most relevant context, extracts the answer using the BERT model, and displays it to the user.

### **Summary of Workflow**
1. **Retrieve Context**: The question is converted to an embedding and matched with the most relevant context from the knowledge base using the FAISS index.
2. **Answer Extraction**: The relevant context is passed to the fine-tuned BERT model to extract a direct answer.
3. **User Interaction**: The user asks questions, and the system responds with the most accurate answer based on the retrieved context.
