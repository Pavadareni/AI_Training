**Text Generation**

The provided code demonstrates how to fine-tune a **GPT-2** model for text generation and then generate text based on user input.

---

### **1. Model and Tokenizer Setup:**
- **GPT-2 Model**: The GPT-2 language model is loaded using the `GPT2LMHeadModel` class from the `transformers` library. This model is fine-tuned to generate text based on a given prompt.
- **Tokenizer**: The tokenizer is used to convert input text into tokens that the model can understand. The `GPT2Tokenizer` handles this conversion, and the `pad_token` is set to `eos_token` (end-of-sequence token), as GPT-2 does not use padding in the traditional sense.

---

### **2. Dataset for Fine-tuning (Text Generation):**
- **Custom Dataset**:
  - A custom `TextGenerationDataset` class is defined to handle the loading and tokenization of the text data. The dataset is split into input tokens, with each tokenized example having a fixed length (`block_size`).
  - The dataset takes a text file (`train.txt` or `test.txt`) and tokenizes the content using the GPT-2 tokenizer, preparing it for training and evaluation.
  
- **DataLoader**:
  - The `DataLoader` is used to load the training and testing datasets in batches for training the model.

---

### **3. Fine-tuning the GPT-2 Model:**
- **Optimizer**: The AdamW optimizer is used with a learning rate of `5e-5`, suitable for fine-tuning transformer models.
- **Training Loop**:
  - The training loop iterates over multiple epochs (`num_epochs = 3` in this case), where for each batch, the model performs a forward pass, calculates the loss, and updates the weights through backpropagation.
  - The loss for each batch is accumulated, and the average loss for each epoch is printed for tracking the training progress.

- **Saving the Model**:
  - After fine-tuning, the model and tokenizer are saved to the `fine_tuned_gpt2` directory for later use.

---

### **4. Model Evaluation:**
- After training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset. In evaluation mode, the model computes the loss for the test data, but gradients are not calculated to save memory and computation.

---

### **5. Text Generation:**
- **Text Generation Function**:
  - The `generate_text()` function is defined to generate text from a given prompt. The function takes several parameters:
    - `max_length`: The maximum length of the generated text.
    - `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the generated text. Lower values make the model more deterministic, and higher values increase randomness.
    - `top_k`: Limits the sampling to the top `k` most likely next words.
    - `top_p`: Uses nucleus sampling, where the model samples from the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability is greater than `p`.
    
  - The `generate()` function of GPT-2 is used to generate the next words in the sequence, conditioned on the provided prompt. The text is then decoded into human-readable form using the tokenizer.

---

### **6. User Interaction:**
- After the model is loaded, the user is prompted to input a text prompt.
- The `generate_text()` function is called with this prompt, and the generated text is printed.

---

### **Key Points:**
- **Fine-tuning GPT-2**: The model is trained on custom text data to adapt it for generating text in a particular style or domain.
- **Text Generation**: After fine-tuning, the model can generate text based on any user-provided prompt using temperature, top-k, and top-p sampling techniques.
- **Flexibility**: This setup allows you to fine-tune GPT-2 on your dataset and easily deploy it for real-time text generation.
