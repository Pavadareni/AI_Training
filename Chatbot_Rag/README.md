**ChatBot using RAG**

This architecture ensures that the chatbot leverages both **retrieved knowledge** and **natural language generation**, making it more effective for knowledge-based queries.

### **1. Loading the Knowledge Base**
- The knowledge base is loaded from a text file (`knowledge.txt`).
- Each line of the file represents a distinct piece of information.
  
### **2. Embedding Creation**
- A **SentenceTransformer** model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) is used to encode the knowledge base into high-dimensional embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.

```python
kb_embeddings = model.encode(knowledge_base)
```

---

### **3. Building the FAISS Index**
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to create an **index** for the knowledge base embeddings.  
- The `IndexFlatL2` index enables fast similarity searches based on **Euclidean distance**.

```python
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(kb_embeddings.shape[1])
index.add(kb_embeddings)
```

---

### **4. Retrieving Relevant Knowledge**
- For a given user query, the SentenceTransformer generates an embedding for the query.
- FAISS searches the knowledge base and retrieves the top-`k` most relevant entries based on similarity.

```python
query_embedding = model.encode([query])
distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding, k)
relevant_docs = [knowledge_base[idx] for idx in indices[0]]
```

---

### **5. Text Generation**
- A **pre-trained generative model** (T5-small in this case) is used for creating conversational responses.  
- The input to the model includes the retrieved context and the user query, formatted as:
  
```python
input_text = f"Context: {context} Query: {query}"
```

- The response is generated using a pipeline from the **Transformers** library.

```python
response = generator(input_text, max_length=50, truncation=True)
```

---

### **6. Combining Retrieval and Generation**
- The chatbot combines **retrieval** and **generation** into a cohesive pipeline:
  - **Step 1:** Retrieve relevant knowledge using FAISS.
  - **Step 2:** Generate a response using the retrieved context and user query.

```python
context = retrieve_relevant_knowledge(query)
response = generate_response(context, query)
```

---

### **7. Interactive Chatbot**
- The chatbot runs in an interactive loop:
  - It prompts the user for input.
  - It processes the query through the RAG pipeline.
  - It outputs a response to the user.
  - The loop ends when the user types "exit" or "quit".

---

### **Workflow Summary**

1. **Query Understanding:** Transform the user query into an embedding using SentenceTransformer.
2. **Knowledge Retrieval:** Search the FAISS index for semantically similar knowledge from the database.
3. **Response Generation:** Generate a contextual response using the retrieved knowledge and the query.
4. **User Interaction:** Present the generated response to the user in a conversational format.
