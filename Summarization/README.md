**Text Summarization**

This script performs **text summarization** using two different pre-trained transformer models: **T5** and **BART**. The goal is to generate a concise summary of a given text using both models and compare their outputs.

---

### **1. T5 for Summarization:**
- **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** is a powerful transformer model that treats every NLP task as a text generation task.
  - **Model & Tokenizer**: 
    - The model and tokenizer are loaded using the `T5ForConditionalGeneration` and `T5Tokenizer` from the Hugging Face library.
    - The model used is `t5-small`, but it can be replaced with larger versions like `t5-base` or `t5-large` for better performance.
  - **Summarization Process**:
    - The input text is prefixed with "summarize:" to guide the model towards performing summarization.
    - The input is tokenized, and the T5 model generates a summary based on specified parameters like maximum and minimum summary lengths, beam search for better quality, and length penalties.
    - The summary is then decoded and returned.

### **2. BART for Summarization:**
- **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)** is another transformer model, particularly effective for text generation tasks like summarization. It is fine-tuned on CNN/DailyMail for summarization tasks.
  - **Model & Tokenizer**: 
    - The `BartForConditionalGeneration` and `BartTokenizer` are used for loading the model and tokenizer, respectively.
    - The model used here is `facebook/bart-large-cnn`, which is pre-trained and fine-tuned for summarization.
  - **Summarization Process**:
    - The input text is tokenized with a maximum length of 1024 tokens, as BART can handle larger inputs than T5.
    - Similar to T5, the BART model generates a summary using parameters like beam search, length penalties, and early stopping.
    - The summary is then decoded and returned.

### **3. Main Workflow:**
- In the main part of the code, an example paragraph about **Artificial Intelligence** is provided.
- **Summarization using T5**: The `summarize_with_t5` function is called to generate a summary.
- **Summarization using BART**: The `summarize_with_bart` function is also called to generate a summary using BART.
- The results from both models are printed, allowing a comparison of the two summarization approaches.

### **Key Parameters for Summarization:**
- **max_length**: The maximum length for the summary.
- **min_length**: The minimum length for the summary.
- **length_penalty**: Controls the length of the summary; higher values favor shorter summaries.
- **num_beams**: Specifies the number of beams in beam search, which is used for generating high-quality summaries.
- **early_stopping**: Ensures that the model stops generating when a complete summary is reached, preventing unnecessary computation.

### **Summary:**
- This script demonstrates how to generate summaries using two powerful transformer models (T5 and BART).
- T5 is a flexible text generation model that can handle a variety of NLP tasks, while BART excels in tasks like summarization due to its architecture.
- The script compares the outputs from both models for a given input text to show their summarization capabilities.
