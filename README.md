# AI_Training
This repository includes extensive advanced AI/ML tasks so that critical techniques in application domains.It provides hands-on implementations of state-of-the-art AI and ML techniques ready to be applied in various projects and research requirements.
 
 ### Tasks:
1.  **Text Classification with Pre-trained Models**: Classify text with BERT, RoBERTa or DistilBERT with only minimal fine-tuning: Real-world adaptability/
2.  **Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A chatbot which uses generative models combined with retrieval for the production of accurate and relevant responses.
3. **Image Captioning with Vision-Language Models**: Describe images using models that bridge vision and language, such as CLIP .
4. **Summarization System with T5 or BART**: Take long texts and produce good summaries for reading quickly.
5. **Question Answering with Dense Retrieval + BERT**: Retrieve answers from text by using dense retrieval techniques combined with BERT .
6. **Text Generation with GPT-3/4**: Fine-tune GPT-3/4 to generate more human-like text for creative or task-specific outputs.
7. **Text-to-Speech System using Quantized Models**: Generate speech from text of high quality using an efficient, quantized model.
8. **Multilingual Sentiment Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis of any text to infer its sentiment across languages using cross-lingual models like XLM-R or mBERT.
9. **Few Shot Learning for Image Classification**: Classify using very few labeled data using methods such as prototypical networks.
10. **Quantization of Neural Networks**: Reduce the model size and speed up inference by quantizing neural networks.
